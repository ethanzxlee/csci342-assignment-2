UI Design Justifications
------------------------
When designing the application, purple colour was chosen as the primary colour because it represents the calm stability and creativity. I think these are what people need when creating a clipping. Furthermore, it looks good on the screen too. 

Therefore, I've overridden the default translucent white colour of the navigation bar with the purple colour. Besides, the tint colours of the UI elements was changed to the purple colour as well.

Then the position of the UI elements were designed by referring to the other iOS apps, for example putting the 'Edit' button for the UITableView on the upper right of the screen.
