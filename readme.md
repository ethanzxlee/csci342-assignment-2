# The Scrapbook

A scrapbook typically holds clippings of different pieces of information that are of interest or use to you.

Some scrapbooks are organised by separate groups/topics such as favourite recipes, mobile app UI designs or picturesque holiday destinations for example, others are disorganised and have a series of time-ordered clippings.

This assignment will involve building a scrapbook that can organise clippings into different groups/topics.

For the purposes of this assignment, a “Clipping” is a piece of information that you’d like to save into the scrapbook. This will include an image and text description. In this assignment, clippings may be organised into groups/topics called “Collections” You could have one collection for recipes and another for holidays.

# UI Design Justifications

When designing the application, purple colour was chosen as the primary colour because it represents the calm stability and creativity. I think these are what people need when creating a clipping. Furthermore, it looks good on the screen too. 

Therefore, I've overridden the default translucent white colour of the navigation bar with the purple colour. Besides, the tint colours of the UI elements was changed to the purple colour as well.

Then the position of the UI elements were designed by referring to the other iOS apps, for example putting the 'Edit' button for the UITableView on the upper right of the screen.
